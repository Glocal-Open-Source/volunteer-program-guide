## What is the GLOCAL Foundation of Canada?
GLOCAL is founded and operated by a passionate and diverse team committed to promoting creative civic engagement with local participation and global understanding. Our team consists of young Canadians from various backgrounds across the globe, brought together by the vision of creating a more inclusive, accessible, and engaging Canadian society. 

## Challenges We Aim to Address
We envision GLOCAL as the “Uber Eats” and talent incubator of civic engagement. The long-term goal at GLOCAL is to provide an on-demand digital civic information delivery platform that connects Canadians with legislators, governments, civil society organizations, communities and other types of political stakeholders in Canada. In doing so, we aim to address the following challenges:
- Civic Information Accessibility (the “last mile” delivery to citizens and residents)
- Information Overload (as one of the root cause for misinformation and disinformation)
- Insufficient Civic Information


## Defining "GLOCAL"
GLOCAL is a term that combines the words "global" and "local" and refers to the concept of thinking and acting both globally and locally. The term is often used in the context of business, politics, and culture, and reflects the idea that the world is becoming increasingly interconnected and interdependent.


In social and political contexts, the GLOCAL approach emphasizes the importance of global awareness and local engagement in addressing public concerns such as climate change, poverty, and inequality. It involves creative problem-solving that takes into account the unique needs and conditions of local communities while also recognizing the global perspectives of these issues. 


The GLOCAL approach also recognizes the need to balance the benefits of globalization with the potential negative impacts on local communities and the environment. This can involve a focus on sustainable development, social responsibility, and ethical practices. 


Overall, the GLOCAL concept emphasizes the importance of finding a balance between global and local perspectives in order to create a more interconnected and sustainable world.
