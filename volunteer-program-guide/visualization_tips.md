# Data Visualization Tips

## Time Series Clarity

-   Display dates/time frames on the x-axis in ascending order (unless thereâ€™s a specific reason not to). This ensures intuitive trend interpretation.

## Label Everything

-   Always label axes and include units (e.g., \"Percentage (%)\" or
    \"Population (thousands)\").
-   Define variables and terms in captions or legends (e.g., clarify if
    \"46.0\" represents people, percentages, or scaled values).

## Title & Context

-   Use clear, descriptive titles that specify the metric and relevant information about the dataset (e.g., \"Mean
    Household Income (2020--2024)\" instead of \"Income Trends\").
-   Indicate whether values are sums, means, medians, etc. (e.g.,
    \"Median Wait Times for Emergency Care\").

## Plot Type Selection

-   **Line charts**: Trends over time
-   **Bar charts**: Category comparisons
-   **Boxplots/Violin plots**: Distributions

More details about each chart type are discussed in this section by Statistics Canada: [Data Visualization](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/edu/power-pouvoir/ch9/5214821-eng.htm)

## Design Best Practices

-   Use consistent colours/legends across plots to aid comparison.
-   Annotate key trends (e.g., \"Peak in 2021\" with an arrow).
-   Avoid clutter: Split complex data into multiple plots.

## Avoid Misleading Scales

-   Start y-axis at zero unless justified (e.g., log scales). If
    truncated, explain why in the caption.

## Accessibility

-   Ensure colour choices are colourblind-friendly (tools: [ColorBrewer](https://colorbrewer2.org/)).
-   Use patterns/textures in addition to colours for B&W printing.

## Normalization for Comparisons

Normalization removes scale differences, letting viewers focus on relative changes.

-   **When to normalize**:

    -   If the main goal is to compare trends or patterns (not
            absolute values), scale values to a common range (e.g., 0--1
            or 0--100%).

-   **How to label**:

    -   Clearly state the normalization method in the axis/caption
            (e.g., *\"Values normalized to 2015 baseline (=100%)\"* or
            \"Percent of total group\").

-   **Caveats**:

    -   Avoid normalization if absolute values matter (e.g., budget
            allocations in dollars).

## Examples

### Infographic: Building Permits in Canada

It's important to include clear elements such as a title, map, explanation, and tables or summary boxes. These elements help ensure your message is easy to understand at a glance.

The infographic below summarizes building permits in Canada for April 2025:

**Notice how it uses a combination of:**

-   **Title**: Clearly states the topic and time period.
-   **Map**: Visualizes geographic differences across provinces and territories.
-   **Explanations**: Uses colour, arrows, and percentages to highlight changes.
-   **Tables/Summaries**: Breaks down the data into categories (residential,
    non-residential) and uses icons for quick interpretation.
-   **Source**: Properly cites the data source at the bottom.
