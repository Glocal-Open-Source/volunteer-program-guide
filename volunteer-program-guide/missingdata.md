# I Can't Find Data for X
This is a very common issue in the world of opendata: many sets are
published as reports, and the methods in which they are obtained vary by
province. You will not always find one set that can be used to describe
X trends for all of Canada—you may even find that certain provinces have no data at all.

This is one of GLOCAL's most important missions—addressing the fact
that it is difficult to obtain this information, especially for the average Canadian.

That being said, what can you do if you cannot find the data that you're looking for? 

## Don'ts
- DO NOT fill missing entries with nullpoints, this can affect analysis and mislead readers
- DO NOT truncate gaps in time series data in an effort to make it look complete, this conceals real discontinuities (that aren't your fault)
- DO NOT rely on automated data cleaning tools without understanding how they handle null values.
- DO NOT ignore metadata or data quality notes - these will usually have the answers that you are looking for. 

## Do's
- Investigate why the data is missing. Is it due to privacy, confidentiality, or simply not reported? 
- Look for alternative datasets that may include missing information. You may even need to find a different source, provided the data is reported in the same manner, then combine the sets.
- If possible, contact the data provider, publisher, or relevant data officers to clarify missing entries.
- Document all assumptions and methods used to handle missing data so that others can assess the reliability of your conclusions.

## If All Else Fails...
First, check, double check, triple check that you are consulting the
correct sources in your study. If you can find all of the data by
modifying your research question, then that is likely your best option.
Narrowing or adjusting the scope of your research can make the project
feasible without compromising its value. **If no data exists, document
that gap**. Absence of information is itself a finding—and noting it
strengthens transparency and highlights areas for future inquiry or
advocacy.
